\section{Definitions}
\subsection{Univariate polynomial}
A univariate polynomial $f$ over a ring $R$ is a mathematical expression of the form
\begin{align}
       f = a_{n}x^{n}  +  a_{n-1}x^{n-1} +  \ldots  +  a_{1}x  &+  a_{0} \label{eq:polynom}
\end{align}
where the $a_{n}, a_{n-1}, \ldots, a_{1}, a_{0}$  are the coefficients of the polynomial and elements of $R$, and $x$ is called an indeterminate or a variable.  The highest $n \geq 0$ is called the degree of the polynomial (such $n$ exists, since the set $\{i \, | \, f_{i} \neq 0 \}$ is finite) and $a_{n} \neq 0$ is called the leading coefficient \parencite{rosicky07}. 

\subsection{Roots of a univariate polynomial}
Let R be a ring, $f = a_{n}x^{n}  +  a_{n-1}x^{n-1} +  \ldots  +  a_{1}x  +  a_{0}$ a polynomial of $R[x]$, $c \in R$. Then an element $a_{n}c^{n}  +  a_{n-1}c^{n-1} +  \ldots  +  a_{1}c  +  a_{0}$ is called a value of the polynomial and we denote it as $f(c)$.

Using this, we can create a polynomial function by mapping every element $x$ of $R$, to the result of a substitution $f(x) = a_{n}x^{n}  +  a_{n-1}x^{n-1} +  \ldots  +  a_{1}x  +  a_{0}$ \parencite{polynomialsChina}.

Let $f$ be a polynomial over $R$, $c \in R$. We say that $c$ is a root of the polynomial $f$ if $f(c) = 0$ \parencite{rosicky07}.

\section{Approximation of a root using iterative methods}
The iterative methods generally require knowledge of one or more initial guesses for the desired root(s) of the polynomial. This often poses a problem itself and there are techniques and methods for finding them. The simplest method for finding a guess is by looking at the plot of the polynomial, which is often not possible (e.g. when dealing with very complex and long polynomials). Some of these methods will be shown later and thus for this section, we will assume we already have a guess.

\subsection{Bisection method}
The simplest method for finding a better approximation of a root is bisection method \parencite{rootApproxMeth}. Assume that function $f(x)$ is continuous on interval $[a,b]$ and that $f(a)f(a) < 0$. Then according to the intermediate value theorem \parencite{interValue} there must be at least one root in $[a,b]$. The interval may be chosen large enough that there is more than one root, this is not a problem however, since the algorithm will always converge to some root $\alpha$ in $[a,b]$ and a smaller interval containing only one root. Since all polynomial functions are continuous \parencite{polyCont}, we can use this theorem to create an algorithm.

\begin{example}
Find a root $\rho$ of 
\begin{align}
      2x^{4} - 3x - 2
\end{align}

with the precision $\epsilon = 0.00005$.
\end{example}

It is fairly straightforward to show that there is a root located between $1 < \rho < 2$ (), so we will use this interval as our initial guess. The results are shown in the table below.

The true solution is

\begin{align}
      \rho \doteq 1.31265975467417
\end{align}

The true error is

\begin{align}
      |\rho - c_{15}| = 0.00000975467417
\end{align}

which is smaller than the required error bound ($0.00005$). Upon closer inspection, it can be noticed that the algorithm found a solution with enough precision in an earlier iteration already (for example $c_{13}$) and it may seem as the computation could have been stopped right then. However, this fact was not known beforehand, because there is no possibility to predict the accuracy in an earlier iteration during computation.

While every iteration gives a better approximation of the true solution, the algorithm is converging rather slowly. To examine the speed of convergence, we first need to characterize it.

\theoremstyle{definition}
\newtheorem{definition}{Definition}

\begin{definition}
  A sequence of iterates $\{ x_{n} | n \geq 0\}$ is said to converge with \textit{order $p \geq 1$} to a point $\alpha$ if
	\begin{align}
      |\alpha - x_{n + 1}| \leq c |\alpha - x_{n}|^{p}  \tag*{$n \geq 0$} 
	\end{align}
	for some $c > 0$. If $p = 1$, the sequence is said to \textit{converge linearly} to $\alpha$. In that case, we require $c < 1$; the constant $c$ is called the \textit{rate of linear convergence} of $x_{n}$ to $\alpha$ \parencite[p.~56]{rootApproxMeth}.
\end{definition}


Let $c_{n}$ denote the $n$th value of $c$ in the algorithm. Then 

\begin{align}
      \rho = \lim_{n\to\infty} c_{n}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
      |\rho - c_{n}| \leq \left[\frac{1}{2}\right]^n (b - a)
\end{align}

where $b - a$ denotes the length of the original interval input into the algorithm. Using our definition, we can say that the bisection algorithm has linear convergence with a rate of $\frac{1}{2}$. That does not necessarily mean that in every iteration the actual error decreases by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$, but that the \textit{average} rate of decrease is $\frac{1}{2}$. This means that it takes on average approximately $3.32$ iterations ($\log_2 10$).

The major deficiency of this algorithm is its very slow rate of convergence, specifically compared to other methods described in the following sections.

On the other hand, the \textit{Bisection algorithm} has several advantages. The first of them being that it is guaranteed to converge if the prerequisites are met(i.e. the $f$ is continuous - which is true for all polynomial functions - and $f(a)f(a) < 0$). The second one being a reasonable error bound. This method also provides upper and lower bounds on the root $\rho$ in every iteration and such belongs in class of methods called \textit{enclosure methods} \parencite{rootApproxMeth}.
